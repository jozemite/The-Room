# The Room
A text based adventure game written in C.

It's a really short game because I wrote it as the final project for my C programming class and I only had 1 week to work on it.
So because I had a short amount of time, I didn't create it as complex as I wanted to.
If you need help passing the game, there is an Excel game guide in the repository as well as the commands required to enter to pass the game at the bottom of the Ramirez.c file.

## How to Play

Execute in your terminal the following command: `gcc Ramirez.c RamirezGameData.c RamirezGameData.h`. That should create a "a.out" file in the same directory. Then just run it: `./a.out`.


## Available Commands

**Look around**: Gives a short description of where you are, as well as what is around you.

**Go [Location/Direction]**: Moves the player to a certain location or direction if accessible.

**Examine [Object]**: Gives a short description of an object in the current location.

**Inventory**: Lists the current items in your posession.

**Quit**: Exits the game.

##
I might expand this game since I really enjoyed creating it, or I might make a new one later. If you're curious, I did get a grade of 100 on it.

This entire project was also created on the IDE CLion.
